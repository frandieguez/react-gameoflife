This project is just a quick just-for-fun project implementaion of the Conway's Game of life with React on CRA. Take it as a tribute implementation to Dr. Conway.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About the Game

[Conway's Game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

- Have a list of predefined list of Cities around the work
- In the initial list show the current weather for each city
- When the user clicks on one city the sidebar must show the forecast for that city

### üé≤ Rules

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, (or populated and unpopulated, respectively). Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## ‚öí How I have built it

I have used an iterative approach. Basically using only React without any additional library.

Hope you like it, and remember this is just a learn-while-doing application nothing fancy nor highly awesome.

## üöÄ Quick start

1. **Install the base tools.**

   Install Yarn to manage dependencies

   ```
   https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/
   ```

   Install the dependencies to work.

   ```
   sh yarn install
   ```

2. **Start developing.**

   Navigate into your new site‚Äôs directory and start it up.

   ```sh
   yarn start
   ```

## üí´ Deploy

## Possible thinks to add

I've implemented this "toy" as fast as possible so I'm quite sure this is not something i could be really proud of. Therefore, here are some ideas to improve it or to add additional features.

- Migrate to a reducer (react context and reducer) to manage the state of the board and cells.
- Add a system to import .lif files into de board.

## ‚ùî And... what else?

If you find a bug or want to suggest a new video service, please let us know in a ticket.

Thanks!!
